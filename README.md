## About Me 
Link: https://ramsey-tisani.github.io/Portfolio/


Although it may be difficult to even try and separate one's self from the majority of what is seen online, it takes more than a few attempts. 
I like to think my infrastructure of CSS including the queries were just enough to get my perspective on things up and running. 
As a student of the program, I still do need more repetition to get this to become a second language. 
This was a unique step in diversifying my portfolio, and am excited in the opportunity to showcase the skills I continue to learn in the course utilizing visual studio and git hub.
